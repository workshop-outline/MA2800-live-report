This workshop builds a simple timeline layout you can reuse for your MA2800 Online Research Document. The page is structured as a sequence of repeated “post” containers, each with a timestamp, an author line (with a highlighted username), and a block of text, with the option to include an image and caption inside the same post. 

The goal is to practise how consistent structure + consistent styling makes research content easier to follow: your CSS centres the timeline column and styles each post like a card (border + shadow), while separate classes control details like timestamp alignment and username emphasis. This is a useful pattern for documenting your project development week by week (research notes, case studies, test shots, mini reflections), and you can later adapt each “post” to include links, screenshots, or short video clips.

Extension exercise (audio): Edit one post so it embeds an audio clip using the HTML `<audio>` tag (with `controls`). This could be a short voice note, ambient sound from the location, or a quick reflection recorded after attending/observing an event. Sound can meaningfully expand the live report experience by conveying atmosphere, distance, urgency, and emotion – major online news reports often use short audio clips or embedded audio segments alongside text and images to add presence and context.
