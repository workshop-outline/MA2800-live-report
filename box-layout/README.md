This workshop uses a simple row/column box layout to present a live report idea as a sequence of sections. The HTML builds repeated .row elements containing two .col boxes (text and image) inside a themed section, so the page reads like a structured research draft rather than a single long paragraph. The CSS uses display: flex on each row and shared styling on the columns (padding, margins, font settings, background) so every box stays consistent and easy to scan.

Task (expand the layout and add media): Duplicate the existing .row blocks to create a longer sequence (at least 4–6 rows total). Treat each new row as a new “research box” that could later become part of your Online Research Document (context, case study, plan, ethics, location notes, etc.). Then integrate at least two new media types inside your boxes:

* Add one video using the <video controls> tag (a short clip, test footage, or documentation).
* Add one audio clip using the <audio controls> tag (ambient sound, a short reflection, or a quick report-style voice note).
  Optional: add a GIF animation (a short looping visual reference) to show mood, movement, or interface ideas. Keep the layout consistent by placing media inside a .col and adjusting width responsively (use CSS rather than fixed widths).
