This first layout workshop introduces a simple, repeatable page structure you can reuse for your MA2800 **Online Research Document**: a clear header (title + short intro) and a vertical column of “posts” that each contain an image and a caption. The sample content (cats and dogs) is only there so you can focus on layout, spacing, and readability rather than the topic.

The key idea is that this same layout can later become your research format for **case studies, visual references, screenshots, and short commentary**, with links back to sources. In this exercise you should practise keeping a consistent structure across posts (image + caption + optional link), and using CSS to control width, alignment, and spacing so your research page stays clear and easy to read.

If you want to extend the layout, you can also add **video** inside one of the post containers. Try replacing an image with the HTML `<video>` tag (with `controls`) so your research page can include short clips or documentation from your live report process.
